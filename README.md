# HOACS - Hardware-Oblivious Arithmetic Coding Scheme

A research implementation of encoding-based countermeasures against side-channel attacks and hardware trojans.

## Overview

HOACS implements Residue Number System (RNS) encoding to protect cryptographic implementations from side-channel analysis. This repository contains implementations for AES and RSA with integrated side-channel countermeasures.

## Features

- RNS-based encoding for side-channel resistance
- AES implementation with HOACS protection
- RSA implementation with HOACS protection
- TVLA (Test Vector Leakage Assessment) analysis suite
- Performance benchmarking tools

## Getting Started

This is a research project. Documentation and usage instructions coming soon.

## Repository Structure

- `/AES` - AES implementation with RNC encoding
- `/TVLA` - Side-channel analysis tools
- `/firmware` - Embedded implementations
- `/docs` - Documentation and analysis results
